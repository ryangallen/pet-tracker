## Challenge

A pet store decides they want a way to keep track of their dogs and cats.
They said they want to be able to store these attributes:

* name
* breed
* birthday

In addition, names are no longer than 30 characters and breed is no longer than 50 characters.

The petstore wants to be able to:

* list all pets
* list all dogs
* list all cats
* view one dog
* view one cat
* add a dog
* add a cat
* delete a dog
* delete a cat

As being part of the team that makes this system, you must create a Django project that has endpoints that can provide these functionalities.  Ideally, Django Rest Framework should be used.
